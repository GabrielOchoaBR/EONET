Hello

I have created this file to explain my ideas about this application.

I created the backend with C# dotnet core 3.1, using DDD + EF + AutoMapper + IoC + Swagger + Code First + DependencyInjection + Migration.

I created the frontend with VueJS, using yarn CLI to help me to run, Vuetify, sweetalert2, Axios, Momentjs, Promises, routes, and some mixins.

I didn't use time with the layout of the application because you probably have a screen layout for all the applications of the company.

The first migration of the application is configured to get only 500 rows otherwise it takes too much time to download all closed events from the NASA API.

Thank you for the opportunity and your time.

Regards
Gabriel Ochoa
